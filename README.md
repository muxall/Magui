# Magui
Muxall Automation GUI Repo

Magui (pronounced: mah-gw-eye) is an acronym for Muxall Automation GUI.  The goal of the Magui is, dare I say, the proverbial automation “big red button”.  Magui provides an abstraction layer that allows users to control and interoperate with network equipment, test equipment, and other subsystems found in IT and Telecom Networks.  Magui provides a “Network Drawing” look and feel that is familiar to Network Engineers.  Although Magui is being developed for automated integration testing, network troubleshooting, and debugging, converting it to a back office provisioning and monitoring system should be easy.

To learn more about the design and layout of the Magui, see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/NetworkEngineeringVideoBlog">Network Engineering Video Blog</a> .
