# Magui
Muxall Automation GUI Repo

Magui (pronounced: mah-gw-eye) is an acronym for Muxall Automation GUI.  The goal of Magui is, dare I say, to be the proverbial automation “big red button”.  Magui provides an abstraction layer that allows users to control and interoperate with network equipment, test equipment, and other subsystems found in IT and Telecom Networks.  Magui provides a “Network Drawing” look and feel that is familiar to Network Engineers.  Although Magui is being developed for automated integration testing, network troubleshooting, and debugging, converting it to a back office provisioning and monitoring system should be easy.

Magui is developed using Microsoft’s Window Presentation Foundation (WPF) which is a subset of the .NET framework.  Magui is coded in Visual BASIC using Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2017’s IDE.  Magui is Open Source software licensed under the MIT License.
